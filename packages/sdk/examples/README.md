# Example extensions

Six small extensions that exercise the SDK contract end to end. They are built
and checked in so they install as-is; edit `main.ts` and rebuild with the command
below when you change one.

| Folder | Capabilities it asks for | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hello-kit` | none | Every UI kit control, the pushes from the app (session, directory, theme), toast, clipboard, open URL, compose into the chat box. No approval dialog. |
| `tasks-demo` | `prompt`, `sessions`, `model`, `conversation` | A fake task list. Attach a task as a chip, link it to the current session, start a session (optionally on a worktree), send a prompt. Appears in the composer + menu as a dialog that loads its own page (`panel/attach.html`, declared as `attach: { mode: "dialog", entry }`): from the + menu it is a picker (`ctx.item` is null); click the attached chip and the same dialog opens on that task's details (`ctx.item` set) with the status and comments it put on `attach` as `data`, read back from `ctx.item.data` (list lookup as fallback), and a Send to chat button. Also declares two `actions` and one command: "Create task from message" on assistant messages opens the dialog on that message's text (`ctx.item.kind === "message"`) with a Create button that toasts and attaches; "Summarize session" in the session menus (`payload: ["messages"]`, hence `conversation`) shows the message count and the first 200 characters of each; `/task DEMO-2` in the chat box is answered by `host.onResolve` in `panel/main.ts` (the app mounts that page off-screen when the panel is closed) and attaches the task. The rail icon shows the open-task count through `host.setBadge` until you open the panel. Draft summary asks the Small Model for one sentence through `host.generate` (capability `model`) and puts it in the chat box. Exercises the approval dialog and `NOT_GRANTED` when you decline. |
| `service-echo` | `service` | A local service process (Node HTTP server on loopback). The panel calls it through `host.serviceRequest` and shows status. Exercises the service approval and spawn/stop lifecycle. |
| `github-token` | `network` | A token integration against `https://api.github.com`. Paste a GitHub token in Settings → Integrations, then the panel lists your repositories through `host.request`. Exercises the OAuth/token store and the request proxy. |
| `tools-only` | none | A `package.json` and nothing else: no panel page, no `panel.entry`. One `tools` rule renders every `mcp.*` tool call in the chat with the JSON views. Shows a page-less extension: no rail icon, no + menu row, the Extensions card says "No panel". Install it, run any MCP tool, and the call's expanded body switches to the JSON summary/tree/raw views. |
| `config-editor` | `filesystem` | Reads `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (declared under `contributes.filesystem`), parses it, and shows it as a browsable tree (Explore tab: keys, types, drill into objects and arrays) next to a raw editor (Raw tab) that saves back atomically. Exercises the outside-project file scope, the missing-file and invalid-JSON states, and the approval dialog's pattern list. |

## Install

`tasks-demo` also declares a full-screen Tasks board. Open it from the Extension pages menu above the session list. It reads registered projects and worktrees, starts sessions without closing the board, shows live session states, opens selected chats, and saves board notes with `host.storage`. An idle session does not mark a task Done.

1. Run the app: `bun run dev` from the repo root, open the URL it prints.
2. Settings → Extensions → paste the absolute path of a folder below → Add:
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/hello-kit`
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/tasks-demo`
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/service-echo`
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/github-token`
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/config-editor`
   - `<repo>/packages/sdk/examples/tools-only`
3. Approve what the dialog lists (or Remove to see the refusal path). The icon appears on the context rail.

## Rebuild after editing

`onReady` is a repeated snapshot, not a one-time mount event. Examples apply the theme on every snapshot, mount controls and register subscriptions once, and update existing handles afterward. Input values and selections belong to the extension. Keep them when switching tabs. Compare relevant connection/settings/item values before refreshing data or replacing content.

For Git URL installs, commit the built JavaScript and the lockfile; ignore `node_modules/`. To publish an extension update, bump its own `package.json` version, rebuild, commit, and push. OpenChamber does not build source or install dependencies during installation.
